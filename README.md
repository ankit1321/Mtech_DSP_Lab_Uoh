#About Josephus_With_recursion

It is generalized code for josephus for n people excluding people in k by using recursion.

#About toh_iterative

It is an generalized code for tower of hanoi for any number of disks taken by user without using recursion.

#Binary search tree(BST)

All operations on bst is done with recursive as well as non-recursive traversal and tree like display is also done.

#Floyd Graph Traversal(Shortest Distance)

Shortest path in graph for each nade as a source to each node as a destination is shown through Floyd_warshal Algorithm.

#Doubly link list(DLL)

This is a flexible link list code with various operations with their generalizations.Various conditions are included for each function such as insert and delete at every position,reversing the link list.

#Permutation 

This code prints each and every possible permutation for n and r.

#Sets

This code firstly take two sets and make sets in ordered list and then find union and intersetion of sets.
